LTI integration for GitHub

This is a Spring/Java server that allows teachers to create courses that integrate with GitHub and their preferred LMS via LTI.
Once a course has been created, the teacher can create "assignments" from starter repositories owned by the teacher.

Assignments are be added to the LMS, allowing students to generate personal copies of repositories that they can then use
to complete and turn in the programming project. Once projects are complete, the teacher can download the repository contents
as zip files for grading.
